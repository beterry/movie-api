## About this project

I’m constantly striving to grow my skills as a developer and UI/UX designer. Although I’ve had experiences working with APIs before, I’ve never used a third party’s API outside a tutorial. To practice working with APIs, I wanted to `GET` data from an API using a popular javascript library called Axios.js and render the data to the screen.

### Goals

- Get data from a third-party API with Axios
- Render the data
